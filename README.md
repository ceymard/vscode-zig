# Note by ceymard

This is a temporary fork of vscode-zig to play with a code completer. It's still pretty wonky, but if you want to try it out, checkout this repository in your `.vscode/extensions` and run `yarn` or `npm install` to install all the necessary dependencies for it to run.

Reload vscode, and voil√†, zig code *should* start being completed.

# vscode-zig
